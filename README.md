# Energy-management-system-program-framework
This repository provides a complete framework for implementing a basic day-ahead linear-program-based EMS for a grid-connected microgrid. It serves as a foundation for users to develop more advanced EMS methods.
The code is well organized, and users can easily define the input information or modify the grid topology as needed. For demonstration purposes, two ten-bus test cases are included.
Our work
"Efficient MPC-Based Energy Management System for Secure and Cost-Effective Microgrid Operations", by Hanyang He, John Harlim, Daning Huang, Yan Li
was developed based on this framework. If this EMS framework is helpful for your research, please consider citing our paper.
The code includes:
1. Microgrid setup;
2. Inverter parameter initialization;
3. Electricity price initialization;
4. Battery-energy storage system initialization;
5. Load and solar power profile preparation (forecasting);
7. Day-ahead EMS scheduling using linear programming (LP);
8. Simulation of EMS scheduling results.
